<h4>Publish Settings [PRO]</h4>

Publish Settings help you set where your Preloader will appear by creating conditions that determine where your Preloaders will appear across your site based on filters such as your Homepage, Entire Site, Pages, Posts, Custom Post Types, Tags or Categories. This makes it easy to make your Preloaders appear on specific pages and not on all your site.

<h4>Run Loader Button</h4>

The Run Loader button allows you to run your Preloader and see how it will work in your site before enabling it. It will auto hide itself at start and then use the Minimum Loading Time, Duration and Delay to give your a live demonstration of how it would work on your site. After the Preloader ends, it will hide itself and appear again after a second to allow you to continue editing it.
